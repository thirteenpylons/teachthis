            <p>Developing your environment.</p>
            <div>
                Lets start by creating the file structure for the site.
                type the following in the desired directory:
                    django-admin startproject [name]
                I'll be calling this project "thiswebsite" so I'll type:
                    (django-admin startproject thiswebsite)

                Make sure that you step inside the thiswebsite directory:
                    cd thiswebsite
                When you list the cwd you should see(manage.py, thiswebsite)
                <div>
                    <p>Make superuser</p>
                    Let's make the admin profile for managing the blog.
                    Within the same directory as manage.py type in:
                        python3 manage.py startapp myblog
                    Once you do that you should have an app named myblog.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
