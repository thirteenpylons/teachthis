# django
    I want to focus on building a feature rich blog first.
    I would like to offer something more of a generic web application
    that could be used as sort of a template to create whatever the
    student has in mind.
    
    It seems that most courses have you build a blog and I want to steer
    away from that... Since I'm learning as well I'm going to start
    this course off with the blog and then I will branch off and
    hopefully ditch the blog because blogs are boring.
