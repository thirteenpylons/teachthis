# teachthis
    My hub for teaching and learning

## Idea
    I'm tired of taking these classes that are missing key elements
    of processes. I do benefit from trying to figure out what they're
    missing, but I just want to build something that has all of the
    steps.

    So this will be an open source guide to teaching coding where
    if the student sees issues they can contribute and make it a
    better class.

## Contributing
    We accept contributions through Pull Requests.
    This project will not get anywhere without you! I simply do not know
    everything and cannot be perfect.
