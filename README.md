# teachthis
My hub for teaching

## Idea
    I'm tired of taking these classes that are missing key elements
    of processes. I do benefit from trying to figure out what they're
    missing, but I just want to build something that has all of the
    steps.

    So this will be an open source guide to teaching coding where
    if the student sees issues they can contribute and make it a
    better class.
